  summary: A set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching
  description: |
    The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
    pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has
    its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond
    to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for
    building proprietary software.
